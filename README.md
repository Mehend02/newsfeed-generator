# Overview

This web page displays news stories from the New York Times. The stories are retrieved using JavaScript fetch() (AJAX) calls to the Top Stories API provided by the New York Times.

**You will need an API key in order to communicate with the API and run this application.**

## Getting an API Key

Visit the New York Times Dev Portal to create an account and get your own API key [https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started]. Be sure to select the **Top Stories API** so you will have the correct type of API key to use this application.

In the file named **nyt.js** within the folder named **js**, you will need to insert your API key on line 3, where it says YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE. The API KEY should be a string in single quotes.
